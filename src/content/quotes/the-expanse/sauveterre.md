He turned and saw something move.
\
Something else, not another cloud like himself, like the others, like matter.
\
Something solid but obscured by the emptiness of material like a shape in the fog.
\
Many shapes, neither light nor dark, but some other thing, some third side of that coin, passing through the spaces between the spaces.
\
Rushing toward them. Toward him.
\
Sauveterre did not notice his death.
