Today I listened to pope Francis' last words. I had heard before that he was an empathetic/sympathetic person.
\
\
But what I heard only further deepened my disdain for humanity. "God protect Christians around the world. In Palestine, Israel and Syria".
\
For a guy whose whole shtick is peace and caring about the other it's very odd to exclude everyone else from your prayers of safety, no?
\
\
It sometimes feels like a big joke some divine entity is playing on me to try to fuck with my head, every time I try to believe and have hope, something weird like this happens.
