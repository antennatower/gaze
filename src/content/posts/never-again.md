The realization that most of the "never again" people are dying or dead is very sobering and terrifying.
\
\
Another realization that's just as terrifying and much more bleak is the realization that they only regretted the atrocities they committed because it ended up harming them and
destroying their lives and not because they realized how inhumane they were being or that the people they were killing weren't subhuman.
\
\
With the new generation, not only do they not see the people as equal, but they also don't have the deterrent that's brought with knowing how it might end up badly for them.
