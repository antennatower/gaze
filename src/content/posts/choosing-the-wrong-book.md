When I was a kid, I used to read a lot, mostly books chosen by my mother. They were short and easy to read.
\
\
Fast forward to 12 years later, and I got into a show called [The Expanse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)>) and when I found out that they weren't going to adapt the last three books,
I had a reason to start reading again. But I didn't just want to read the last 3 books, I wanted to read the whole series from the start to not miss any nuances and details that were omitted in the show.
So I, like one does, pirated the first book and started reading. It was my first time reading a book in English, and it was slow, tedious and frustrating. I had to google many words and expressions.
I slowly developed a fitting pattern of knowing what words to google and what to try to understand from context.
After struggling through the first book, I took a long break, but I continued with the series and I got better at it.
\
\
After finishing the series, it was time to move away from sci-fi and into a different genre. Besides the fact that The Expanse had ruined other sci-fi for me because of how good it was.
\
\
Crime and Punishment was mentioned in a YouTube video I was watching, and the premise intrigued me, so Crime and Punishment it was. I bought the book this time. Hard-cover. And started reading.
\
\
This was a mistake. [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky)'s writing is dense and complex. The pacing was worlds apart from The Expanse. The names were hard to remember,
the characters were called by different names at different times, and nicknames were used with no prior warning. Right now, I'm at page 570 out of about 630. I have only a few dozen pages left, but I'm moving very slowly. I'm sad to say that I'm not enjoying the experience, even though the ideas, themes and characters are very interesting. It's just too hard and dense for someone who's just getting back into reading.
\
\
I'm going to finish it as fast as I can and then read something lighter next. Maybe I'll come back to Doestoevsky when I'm more experienced.

Thesis: Skill issue.
